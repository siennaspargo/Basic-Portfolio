# Basic-Portfolio

This is the beginning of my Portfolio

So far into my HTML I have incorportated CSS and Bootstrap.

I have created a simple page that is appealing to my taste with clean colors, 
fun fonts that reflect my personality. I also added an emoji plug in into my page.

I have added a small blurb about me, and have connected my Github, LinkedIn, and Stack OverFlow pages.

Some things I am having an issue with are is :

- Mobile responsiveness/ responsive to detecting the size of the window/ stacking properly when minimized screen size.

- Making my images responsive to the size of the page.
